# PokeFinder

This is just a simple little React project that I started for fun and have used to practice my frontend UI skills, simple as that. I am and have alwasy been a big Pokemon fan so I decided to leverage a Pokemon API (see link below) to create this app. 

# Tools Used

- [React.js](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-react-dev)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/docs/getting-started/introduction)
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

# Important things to note

- Currently the PokeAPI does not conatin data for ALL pokemon.
- I do not own any rights to the pokemon brand or their characters/pokemon, this app does not have any association with the company or brand Pokemon.
